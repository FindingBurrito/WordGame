# Gen Z Word Scramble 🌀

This is a fun little Python program I created based on a C++ word scramble game I originally worked on for class. I wanted to give it a modern, playful twist—so this version uses Gen Z slang words instead of regular vocabulary.

## 👾 What It Does

- Scrambles a random Gen Z slang word
- You try to guess the original word
- You earn points for correct answers
- Your score is saved to a local file and ranked against others
- High scores persist between sessions

### 🔁 Features

- Random shuffling with a check to make sure it’s different from the original
- File I/O to load and save high scores (`highscores.txt`)
- Basic sorting to keep top scores at the top
- Console-only, no external libraries needed

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is just for fun and not meant to offend anyone. The slang terms are included in a lighthearted, humorous way. It's simply a playful take on a classic word scramble concept.

## 📚 Inspiration

This Python version was inspired by a C++ version I created in class to practice object-oriented programming and algorithms. I decided to redo it in Python with a fresh vibe to show my ability to work across different languages.
